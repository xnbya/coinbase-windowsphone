Coinbase app for Windows Phone

Due to the lack of a usable wallet on WP7, I decided to make one myself based on the Coinbase API. It currently supports most of the features provided, including sending bitcoins, buying / selling & viewing the history. As it supports WP7, it has no integration with the wallet hub and is a fully standalone app. 

Features working:
* sending BTC
* viewing history
* buying / selling bitcoins
* QR scanner

Some features yet to be added:
* pincode for app
* ability to send requests
* support for Coinbase's merchant
